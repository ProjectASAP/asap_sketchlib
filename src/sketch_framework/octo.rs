//! OctoSketch multi-threaded sketch framework.
//!
//! Implements the parent-child delta-promotion architecture from OctoSketch (NSDI 2024).
//! Worker threads maintain lightweight child sketches with one-byte counters and emit
//! compact delta entries via per-worker channels when a counter reaches the promotion
//! threshold τ. An aggregator thread applies deltas to a full-precision parent sketch
//! and adjusts τ to keep its receive rate matched to the workers' send rate.
//!
//! The three ideas of §3.2 map onto this module as follows:
//!
//! - Idea 1, change-based updates: [`OctoWorker`] emits one counter at a time
//!   instead of shipping whole sketches.
//! - Idea 2, adaptive resource allocation: [`OctoAdaptiveThreshold`] drives the
//!   shared [`OctoThreshold`] from the aggregator's queue occupancy.
//! - Idea 3, reconstructed data structures: [`CmWorkerSketch`] and
//!   [`CountWorkerSketch`] drop flow-key storage and use one-byte counters,
//!   while the `*TopK*` aggregators hold the only heavy-hitter heap.
//!
