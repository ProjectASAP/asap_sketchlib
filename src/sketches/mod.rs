//! Core sketch implementations.
//!
//! This module is the main entry point for the library's sketch algorithms.
//! Broadly, the sketches fall into a few common use cases:
//!
//! - frequency estimation: [`CountMin`], [`Count`]
//! - cardinality estimation: [`HyperLogLog`]
//! - quantiles and distributions: [`KLL`], [`DDSketch`]
//! - specialized or composite structures: heap-backed, folded, and
//!   runtime-oriented variants such as [`CMSHeap`], [`CSHeap`], [`FoldCMS`], and
//!   [`FoldCS`]
//!
//! For most users:
//!
//! - choose [`CountMin`] for fast approximate non-negative frequency queries
//! - choose [`Count`] for Count Sketch style frequency estimation
//! - choose [`HyperLogLog`] for distinct counts
//! - choose [`KLL`] for general quantile estimation
//! - choose [`DDSketch`] when relative-error quantiles are important
//!
//! [`FastPath`] and [`RegularPath`] control how some matrix-backed frequency
//! sketches map values to rows and columns. Several specialized sketches in
//! this module are feature-gated behind `experimental`.
//!
//! ## `*sketch` vs `*sketch_topk` files
//!
//! For each Count-Min / Count Sketch style algorithm we ship two files:
//!
//! - [`countminsketch`] / [`countsketch`] — the core sketch (matrix of
//!   counters only). Answers point-frequency queries: "how often did key `k`
//!   appear?" These do not track which keys are heavy hitters.
//! - [`countminsketch_topk`] / [`countsketch_topk`] — the same sketch paired
//!   with a min-heap that tracks the top-`k` heavy hitters as items stream in
//!   ([`CMSHeap`], [`CSHeap`] / [`CountL2HH`]). Use these when the question is
//!   "which keys are the most frequent?" rather than "how often did this
//!   specific key appear?"
//!
//! The split keeps the core sketch lean for callers that only need point
//! queries, while the `_topk` variants compose the sketch with heap
//! bookkeeping for heavy-hitter workloads.
