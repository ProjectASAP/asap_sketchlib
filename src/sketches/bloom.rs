//! # Bloom filter
//!
//! Approximate set membership: `contains` never says no about a key that was
//! inserted, and says yes about some keys that were not.
//!
//! This is the *partitioned* variant. The filter is a [`BitMatrix`](crate::BitMatrix) of `rows`
//! slices by `cols` bits, one slice per hash function, which is the same
//! `rows x cols` shape [`CountMin`] probes — one cell per row,
//! folded from the same seeded hashes. A membership query is the minimum across
//! rows, which over single bits is their AND.
//!
//! ## Reference
//! * Bloom, "Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable Errors",
//!   CACM 1970.
//! * Kirsch and Mitzenmacher, "Less Hashing, Same Performance", ESA 2006, for
//!   the per-slice partitioning.
