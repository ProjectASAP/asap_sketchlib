#![doc = include_str!("../README.md")]
//! `asap_sketchlib` is organized into the following layers:
//!
//! - [`sketches`]: core sketch data structures such as Count-Min, HyperLogLog,
//!   KLL, and DDSketch.
//! - [`common`]: shared input types, hashing abstractions, storage backends, and
//!   reusable utilities used across sketches.
//! - [`proto`]: portable protobuf message types for sketch interchange.
//! - [`sketch_framework`]: higher-level composition layers such as Hydra,
//!   UnivMon, tumbling windows, and batch/parallel execution helpers.
//! - [`message_pack_format`]: MessagePack/proto wire format shared with
//!   `sketchlib-go`. Owns the wire-DTO sketch types consumed by the ASAP
//!   query engine (`CountMinSketch`, `CountSketch`, `KllSketch`, `HllSketch`,
//!   `DdSketch`, `HydraKllSketch`, `CountMinSketchWithHeap`,
//!   `SetAggregator`, `DeltaResult`).
//!
//! Most users can start with the crate-root re-exports such as [`DataInput`],
//! [`CountMin`], [`HyperLogLog`], [`KLL`], and [`DDSketch`]. Reach for the
//! submodules directly when you need lower-level storage, hashing, or
//! framework-specific APIs.

/// Shared primitives used across sketches, including input wrappers, hashers,
/// storage backends, and reusable utilities.
