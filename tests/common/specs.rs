//! Error-model specifications, one per *error metric*, plus the statistical
//! machinery that turns a guarantee into an acceptance rule.
//!
//! The specs in [`super::conformance`] carry loose smoke-test tolerances,
//! which is the right thing for wiring up a new adapter but wrong as a
//! statement of theory: KLL promises *rank* error while DDSketch promises
//! *relative value* error, and Count-Min's one-sided additive `eps*N` is not
//! Count Sketch's two-sided `L2/sqrt(w)`. Each spec here models exactly one
//! guarantee and nothing else, so no two families can be judged by the same
//! number by accident.
//!
//! # The statistical unit
//!
//! A bound of the form `P[error > B] <= p` is a statement about **one** draw of
//! the randomness the estimator is built on — one hash choice, one compaction
//! coin sequence, one sampling seed. Turning `n` observed checks into a
//! binomial tail at `p` requires those `n` checks to be `n` *independent draws
//! of that randomness*. Almost none of the natural check batteries are:
//!
//! - several quantiles `q` read off **one** KLL sketch share one compaction
//!   history;
//! - several keys read off **one** Count-Min or Count Sketch share one hash;
//! - increasing checkpoints on **one** HLL or KMV are nested — the later
//!   estimate contains the earlier one's state;
//! - a single-pass sketch and its merged twin share most of their state.
//!
//! So this file offers three acceptance rules and each caller must pick the one
//! that matches what it actually collected:
//!
//! | Rule | When it is valid |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`Tally::assert_none`] | structural facts, and *simultaneous* bounds whose failure probability was already union-bounded down over every check in the battery |
//! | [`Tally::assert_independent_binomial`] | every recorded check is a separate draw of the estimator's randomness (a fresh sketch seed, a fresh hash, a fresh sampling seed) |
//! | [`Tally::assert_rate_at_most`] | one fixed realisation, pinned against the guarantee's own marginal probability — a regression pin, not a probability statement |
//!
//! The way a battery over one sketch becomes a legitimate trial is to reduce it
//! to a single outcome first: the sketch's *maximum* rank error over the whole
//! `q` grid, or whether *any* probed key broke a simultaneous bound. That one
//! outcome, repeated over independent seeds, is a binomial.
//!
//! Where a guarantee has no closed form, or the public API cannot expose the
//! dimension it quantifies over, the test says so and is named
//! `*_stays_within_the_documented_empirical_band` rather than being dressed up
//! as theory. See `docs/e2e_coverage_matrix.md` for which is which.
