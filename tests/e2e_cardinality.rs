//! E2E cardinality pipelines on synthetic unique streams.
//!
//! Every band here is computed from the estimator's own relative standard
//! error and an explicit Gaussian quantile `z`; none is a flat percentage.
//! That distinction matters because the three estimators do *not* share an
//! error model:
//!
//! - `Classic` is Flajolet et al.'s register estimator, RSE `1.04 / sqrt(m)`.
//! - `ErtlMLE` is the maximum-likelihood estimator over the same registers; it
//!   attains the Cramer-Rao bound `sqrt(3 ln 2 - 1) / sqrt(m) = 1.0389/sqrt(m)`,
//!   so the same constant applies.
//! - `HIP` integrates the insertion history and is strictly tighter, RSE
//!   `sqrt(ln 2 / m) = 0.8326 / sqrt(m)`. Holding it to Classic's constant
//!   would pass a HIP implementation that had silently degraded to a register
//!   estimator, so it is held to its own.
//!
//! A single hard-coded 2% would be simultaneously too loose at p16 (4.9 sigma)
//! and too tight at p12 (1.2 sigma), which is why it is gone.
