//! E2E quantile pipelines on synthetic numeric streams.
//!
//! The two quantile families here answer *different questions* and are held to
//! *different* error metrics:
//!
//! - **KLL** promises **rank** error: the returned value's rank must be within
//!   `eps(k)` of the requested `q`. Its value error is unbounded — on a
//!   heavy-tailed stream a correct KLL can return a value 100x off and still
//!   be within its guarantee — so checking `|est - true| / true` against a
//!   percentage tests nothing KLL claims.
//! - **DDSketch** promises **relative value** error: the returned value must
//!   be within `alpha` of the exact order statistic. Its rank error is
//!   unbounded, so a rank band tests nothing DDSketch claims.
//!
//! Neither may be run through the other's battery. `KllRankSpec` and
//! `RelativeQuantileSpec` in `common::specs` keep them apart.
//!
//! Every sketch here is built with an explicit compaction seed. KLL's coin is
//! the sketch's own randomness and is entirely separate from the stream seed;
//! the wall-clock-seeded `KLL::init_kll` / `KLLDynamic::init_kll` constructors
//! cannot be used in an accuracy test because a failure would not reproduce.
//!
//! # Trial units
//!
//! The KLL number `eps(k) = 2.446 / k^0.9433` is Apache DataSketches'
//! characterization fit to the 99th percentile of the **maximum** rank error
//! over a whole quantile grid — not a theorem about this implementation, and
//! not a per-`q` failure probability. So a KLL battery reduces each sketch to
//! one number (its worst rank error over the grid), each sketch gets its **own
//! compaction seed**, and the binomial is taken over those independent seeds.
//!
//! DDSketch's guarantee is deterministic — bucket width alone, no hash and no
//! sampling — so its batteries tolerate zero violations and no statistical
//! model applies. The two shipped implementations answer a quantile query with
//! **different order statistics**, so each is compared against the truth for
//! its own convention; see `DdRankConvention`.
