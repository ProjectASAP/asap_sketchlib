//! E2E frequency-sketch pipelines on synthetic streams with exact ground
//! truth.
//!
//! Two different error metrics live in this file and must not be confused:
//!
//! - **Count-Min** is one-sided and *additive*: `est >= f` always, and the
//!   excess is bounded by `e * (N - f) / w` with probability `1 - e^-d`.
//! - **Count Sketch** is two-sided and *L2*: the error is
//!   `sqrt(kappa / w) * ||f_-i||_2`, rank-independent, and has nothing to do
//!   with `eps * N`. A Count Sketch checked against `e/w * N` is not being
//!   checked against its own theorem — that bound is enormously looser on a
//!   skewed stream, and passing it says almost nothing.
//!
//! Both bounds live in `common::specs` alongside the binomial acceptance rules
//! that turn a per-key failure probability into a pass/fail decision.
