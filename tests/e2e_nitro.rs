//! Nitro sampling, end to end: the row-level accelerator behind
//! `CountMin::fast_insert_nitro` / `Count::fast_insert_nitro`, and the
//! `NitroBatch` wrapper's two ingestion paths.
//!
//! # The model every band here is computed from
//!
//! Nitro admits each unit of work with probability `p` and compensates by
//! writing a weight of `1/p`. Counters are integers, so the weight is rounded
//! **stochastically** — `floor(1/p) + Bernoulli(frac(1/p))` — which makes the
//! estimator unbiased at every rate rather than only at rates whose reciprocal
//! is an integer. With `r = frac(1/p)` and `f` units of true work:
//!
//! ```text
//!   E[estimate]   = f
//!   Var[estimate] = f * ( (1-p)/p  +  p * r * (1-r) )
//!                       \_________/    \___________/
//!                        admission       rounding
//! ```
//!
//! Every band below is `z` standard deviations of that, computed per rate from
//! the sketch's own configuration. Nothing here is a percentage.
//!
//! Unbiasedness is exact given uniform draws; that the shared skip table and
//! the rounding stream supply them is a modelling assumption, and the normal
//! approximation behind the `z`-sigma band is another. The coverage matrix
//! files Nitro as `asymptotic model` for both reasons.
//!
//! # The unit of work differs between the two APIs
//!
//! - **Row-level** (`fast_insert_nitro`): NitroSketch's per-row sampling. A
//!   `d`-row sketch turns `f` updates of a key into `f * d` *row slots*, each
//!   admitted independently. So row `r`'s counter is an estimate of `f` from
//!   `f` slots.
//! - **`NitroBatch`**: samples per *update*, and an admitted update writes its
//!   weight into every row. So the unit is `f`, and every row carries the same
//!   total.
//!
//! Either way the per-row statistic estimates `f` with the variance above,
//! which is what lets [`PATHS`] score all five ingestion paths against one
//! spec. Getting the unit wrong by a factor of `d` is exactly the kind of
//! error these tests exist to catch, so `nitro_estimate` / `estimate_median`
//! are pinned exactly at `p = 1` rather than only inside a band.
//!
//! # Trial units
//!
//! The randomness is the sampling schedule. One `(path, rate, seed)` triple is
//! one draw; the rows *inside* one sketch share an interleaved skip stream and
//! are not independent, so a trial's rows are reduced to a single pass/fail
//! before the binomial runs over seeds.
//!
//! Seeds are spaced so that no two trials read overlapping stretches of the
//! shared skip table — see `TRIAL_STRIDE`.
