//! Every built-in `NumericalValue` type carried through the generic sketches:
//! `KLL<T>`, `KLLDynamic<T>` and `DDSketch::add<T>`.
//!
//! The library implements `NumericalValue` for fourteen concrete types —
//! `i8 i16 i32 i64 i128 isize`, `u8 u16 u32 u64 u128 usize`, `f32 f64` — and
//! each is a public instance a caller can reach. A suite that only ever
//! instantiates `f64` would not notice a type whose ordering or `to_f64`
//! projection was wrong for its own domain: `u128` overflowing an intermediate,
//! `i8` wrapping in a comparison, `f32` losing a tie.
//!
//! Both sketches keep their own error metric here — rank error for the KLL
//! family, relative value error for DDSketch. The type is what varies, not the
//! contract.
//!
//! ## The `to_f64` projection
//!
//! `NumericalValue::to_f64` is how a value reaches the sketch's arithmetic, and
//! for `i128`/`u128` (and `i64`/`u64` past `2^53`) that projection is itself
//! lossy — 64 and 128-bit integers have more distinct values than `f64` has
//! mantissa bits. Ground truth here is therefore taken over the **projected**
//! values, which is precisely what the sketch was handed. The precision limit
//! that belongs to the caller's type choice is covered separately and
//! explicitly by `the_f64_projection_is_exact_below_two_to_the_53`.
